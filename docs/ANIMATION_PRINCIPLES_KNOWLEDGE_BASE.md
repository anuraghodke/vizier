## Principle 1: Squash and Stretch

### Definition
Objects deform during motion to convey weight, flexibility, and impact. The object compresses (squash) when force is applied and elongates (stretch) when moving quickly. **Critical**: Volume must remain constant.

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Object is accelerating or decelerating rapidly
- Object is bouncing or colliding with surface
- Object is flexible (rubber ball, character body, clothing)
- NOT rigid objects (metal box, stone, hard surfaces)
- Speed change > 30% between frames

**Priority**: 4/5 (High - essential for appeal)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "squash_factor": float,      # 0.5-0.9 (compression ratio)
    "stretch_factor": float,     # 1.1-1.5 (elongation ratio)
    "axis": str,                 # "vertical", "horizontal", "both"
    "timing": {
        "squash_frame": int,     # Frame where max squash occurs
        "stretch_frame": int,    # Frame where max stretch occurs
    },
    "volume_preservation": bool, # Always True
    "rigidity": float            # 0.0-1.0 (0=jelly, 1=rigid)
}
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- Calculate object volume in both keyframes
- Squash: Compress along impact axis, expand perpendicular
- Stretch: Elongate along motion axis, compress perpendicular
- Peak squash at moment of contact/max force
- Peak stretch at maximum velocity
- Return to normal shape at rest

### Examples

**Bouncing Ball**:
- Stretch in air (motion direction)
- Squash on contact with ground
- Return to circle at apex of bounce

**Character Jump**:
- Squash during anticipation (crouch)
- Stretch during ascent (upward motion)
- Normal at apex
- Stretch during fall
- Squash on landing

**Running Character**:
- Subtle squash on foot contact
- Stretch during push-off
- Rhythmic squash/stretch cycle

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Forgetting volume preservation (ball gets bigger/smaller)
- ❌ Applying to rigid objects (metal box squashing)
- ❌ Too subtle (loses impact)
- ❌ Too extreme (looks broken)

### Conflicts
- **Solid Drawing**: If volume isn't preserved, breaks 3D illusion
- **Exaggeration**: Balance between exaggeration and believability

---

## Principle 2: Anticipation

### Definition
A preparatory movement in the opposite direction before the main action. Helps the audience prepare for and understand upcoming motion.

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Large, sudden movement detected between keyframes
- Direction changes abruptly
- Action requires force (jump, throw, hit)
- Motion magnitude > 100px or > 45 degrees rotation
- User instruction mentions: "sudden", "quick", "jump", "throw"

**Priority**: 3/5 (Medium - improves readability but not always needed)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "anticipation_amount": float,   # 0.2-0.5 (relative to main action)
    "anticipation_direction": str,  # "opposite", "coil", "wind_up"
    "anticipation_frames": int,     # 1-3 frames
    "main_action_frames": int,      # Remaining frames
    "blend_transition": bool        # Smooth vs snappy
}
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Before Jump**: Character crouches (opposite of jump up)
- **Before Throw**: Arm pulls back (opposite of throw forward)
- **Before Run**: Character leans back slightly
- Anticipation is typically 20-30% of total motion
- Can be very brief (1 frame) for snappy actions

### Examples

**Character Jumping Up**:
1. Keyframe 1: Standing
2. Anticipation: Crouch down
3. Main action: Launch upward
4. Keyframe 2: In air

**Throwing Object**:
1. Keyframe 1: Arm extended
2. Anticipation: Pull arm back, twist torso
3. Main action: Rapid forward motion
4. Keyframe 2: Follow-through position

**Direction Change**:
1. Keyframe 1: Running right
2. Anticipation: Lean right, plant foot
3. Main action: Pivot and accelerate left
4. Keyframe 2: Running left

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ No anticipation for large actions (looks unnatural)
- ❌ Too much anticipation (telegraphs action too early)
- ❌ Wrong direction (doesn't oppose main action)

### Conflicts
- **Slow In and Slow Out**: Anticipation itself should ease in
- **Timing**: Balance anticipation frames vs main action frames

### Note for Telekinesis
Since we're working with only 2 keyframes, anticipation may be **implied** rather than explicit. If keyframe 1 shows a preparatory pose, inform the planner to emphasize it.

---

## Principle 3: Staging

### Definition
Present ideas clearly so the audience understands what's happening. Avoid clutter, ensure important actions are visible, use clear silhouettes.

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Multiple objects in scene
- Complex motion with many parts
- Main subject could be obscured
- Background elements present
- User instruction emphasizes specific element

**Priority**: 2/5 (Medium-Low - more about composition than motion)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "primary_subject": str,         # Which object/character is main focus
    "camera_angle_preference": str, # "profile", "3/4", "straight_on"
    "clarity_mode": str,            # "silhouette", "contrast", "depth"
    "secondary_elements": List[str], # Elements to de-emphasize
    "attention_direction": dict     # Where viewer should look
}
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- Identify primary subject from analysis
- Ensure primary subject has clear silhouette throughout motion
- Secondary motion should support, not distract
- Use depth separation if possible
- Maintain readability in every frame

### Examples

**Character Waving Hand**:
- Hand motion is primary
- Ensure hand not obscured by body
- Keep arm in clear profile or 3/4 view

**Ball Bouncing With Background**:
- Ball is primary subject
- Background should be static or subtly animated
- Ensure ball contrasts with background

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Multiple elements competing for attention
- ❌ Important action obscured by other objects
- ❌ Busy background distracts from main action

### Conflicts
- **Secondary Action**: Must balance secondary with staging clarity

### Note for Telekinesis
Primarily relevant for VALIDATOR - check if generated frames maintain clear staging. Less critical for PLANNER unless multi-object scene.

---

## Principle 4: Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose

### Definition
Two animation approaches:
- **Straight Ahead**: Draw frame by frame from start to finish
- **Pose to Pose**: Draw key poses first, fill in-betweens later

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
This principle defines our CORE METHODOLOGY. Telekinesis is fundamentally a **Pose to Pose** system - we receive key poses (keyframes) and generate in-betweens.

**Priority**: 5/5 (Critical - defines system architecture)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "approach": "pose_to_pose",     # Always this for Telekinesis
    "key_poses": List[int],         # [0, final_frame]
    "breakdown_poses": List[int],   # Could add mid-point extremes
    "interpolation_method": str     # "smart", "linear", "spline"
}
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- Our keyframes ARE the key poses
- PLANNER generates breakdown poses (frame schedule)
- GENERATOR interpolates between breakdowns
- Could extend to suggest intermediate breakdowns for complex motions

### Future Extension
For complex motions (>16 frames), PRINCIPLES agent could suggest:
"This motion needs a breakdown pose at frame 8 - please provide a third keyframe"

### Note for Telekinesis
This principle justifies our entire approach. Reference it when explaining the system.

---

## Principle 5: Follow Through and Overlapping Action

### Definition
Different parts of an object move at different rates. When the main body stops, flexible parts continue moving (follow through). Parts start and stop at different times (overlapping action).

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Object has flexible parts (hair, clothing, tails, antennae)
- Character has appendages that trail main body
- Rapid stop or direction change detected
- Object segmentation identifies multiple parts with different rigidity

**Priority**: 4/5 (High - essential for natural motion)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "parts": [
        {
            "name": "hair",
            "rigidity": 0.1,           # 0=very flexible, 1=rigid
            "delay_frames": 2,         # Frames behind main body
            "damping": 0.8,            # How quickly it settles (0-1)
            "attachment_point": dict   # Where it connects to main body
        },
        {
            "name": "cape",
            "rigidity": 0.2,
            "delay_frames": 3,
            "damping": 0.6,
            "attachment_point": dict
        }
    ],
    "main_body": str,                  # "torso", "head", etc.
    "motion_stagger": bool             # True for overlapping action
}
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- Identify rigid vs flexible parts in ANALYZER
- Main body follows primary motion path
- Flexible parts lag behind by `delay_frames`
- Apply damping to slow oscillations
- Each part has own motion curve

### Examples

**Character Stopping**:
1. Body stops at keyframe 2
2. Hair continues forward 2 more frames
3. Hair swings back and settles over 3 frames
4. Clothing fabric ripples settle over 4 frames

**Dog Wagging Tail**:
- Tail base follows body motion
- Tail tip lags 2-3 frames behind base
- Creates wave motion through tail

**Running Character's Hair**:
- Head bobs up/down
- Hair follows with delay
- Hair at tips has more delay than roots

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ All parts moving in sync (looks stiff)
- ❌ Too much delay (parts look disconnected)
- ❌ No damping (oscillates forever)

### Conflicts
- **Timing**: Must coordinate timing of overlapping parts
- **Solid Drawing**: Parts must maintain connection to body

### Implementation in Telekinesis
**Challenge**: Requires segmenting object into parts with different motion
**Solution**:
1. ANALYZER segments object and identifies flexible parts
2. PLANNER creates separate motion schedules per part
3. GENERATOR renders parts as layers, composites with offset timing

---

## Principle 6: Slow In and Slow Out

### Definition
Actions don't start and stop instantly. Objects accelerate gradually from rest and decelerate gradually to rest. More frames near the extremes of motion, fewer in the middle.

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Almost ALWAYS applies (except intentionally mechanical motion)
- Any smooth, natural motion
- User doesn't specify "constant speed" or "linear"

**Priority**: 5/5 (Critical - most fundamental timing principle)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "ease_type": str,              # "ease_in", "ease_out", "ease_in_out"
    "ease_strength": float,        # 0.0-1.0 (how gradual)
    "curve_type": str,             # "quadratic", "cubic", "sine", "custom"
    "frame_spacing": List[float],  # [0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.65, 0.85, 0.95, 1.0]
    "start_slow_frames": int,      # Frames at start
    "end_slow_frames": int,        # Frames at end
}
```

### Easing Functions

**Ease In** (start slow, accelerate):
```python
t_eased = t ** 2  # Quadratic
# Use for: falling, throwing, attacking
```

**Ease Out** (decelerate, end slow):
```python
t_eased = 1 - (1 - t) ** 2  # Quadratic
# Use for: landing, coming to rest, settling
```

**Ease In-Out** (slow both ends):
```python
if t < 0.5:
    t_eased = 2 * t ** 2
else:
    t_eased = 1 - 2 * (1 - t) ** 2
# Use for: most natural motion, swinging, organic movement
```

### Frame Spacing Examples

**Linear (NO slow in/out)**:
```
Frames: 0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, 1.0
Result: Robot-like, mechanical
```

**Ease In-Out** (natural):
```
Frames: 0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.5, 0.65, 0.85, 0.95, 1.0
Result: Smooth, organic
```

**Ease Out** (landing):
```
Frames: 0.0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.55, 0.70, 0.82, 0.92, 0.98, 1.0
Result: Gradually comes to rest
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- Default to ease-in-out unless reason otherwise
- Heavier objects = stronger ease (more gradual)
- Lighter objects = less ease (snappier)
- Match ease curve to object's perceived weight

### Examples

**Ball Rolling**:
- Ease in at start (overcomes static friction)
- Ease out at end (slows to stop)
- Middle frames more evenly spaced

**Character Head Turn**:
- Ease in at start
- Ease out at end
- Very smooth, natural motion

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Linear spacing (looks mechanical)
- ❌ Too aggressive ease (looks floaty)
- ❌ No ease on heavy objects (ignores physics)

### Conflicts
- **Timing**: Works together - slow in/out is HOW timing is controlled

---

## Principle 7: Arc

### Definition
Most natural motion follows curved paths (arcs), not straight lines. This applies to swinging limbs, turning heads, bouncing balls, and even linear translations (which often have subtle arcs).

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Rotation detected (head turn, arm swing, leg movement)
- Pendulum motion
- Ballistic motion (throwing, jumping)
- ANY organic motion
- NOT: mechanical sliding, piston motion

**Priority**: 5/5 (Critical - natural motion almost always has arcs)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "arc_type": str,               # "circular", "elliptical", "parabolic"
    "arc_center": dict,            # {"x": float, "y": float} (pivot point)
    "arc_radius": float,           # Radius for circular arcs
    "arc_angle": float,            # Total angle swept (degrees)
    "gravity_influence": float,    # 0-1 for parabolic arcs
    "control_points": List[dict],  # For bezier/spline arcs
    "plane": str                   # "xy", "xz", "yz" for 3D thinking
}
```

### Arc Types

**Circular Arc** (fixed pivot):
- Arm swinging from shoulder
- Head turning on neck
- Pendulum swinging
```python
x = center_x + radius * cos(angle)
y = center_y + radius * sin(angle)
```

**Elliptical Arc** (non-circular):
- Walking feet (elliptical path)
- Swinging with varying radius
```python
x = center_x + radius_x * cos(angle)
y = center_y + radius_y * sin(angle)
```

**Parabolic Arc** (gravity):
- Thrown ball
- Jumping character
- Any ballistic motion
```python
x = x0 + vx * t
y = y0 + vy * t - 0.5 * g * t^2
```

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Detect pivot points or launch points
2. Calculate arc path
3. Distribute frames along arc (not linear in x/y)
4. Apply slow in/out along arc path
5. All points on object follow parallel arcs

### Examples

**Head Turn (90 degrees)**:
- Pivot: base of neck
- Arc: circular, 90-degree sweep
- Nose tip follows larger arc than center of head

**Arm Swing**:
- Pivot: shoulder joint
- Arc: slightly elliptical (not pure circle due to anatomy)
- Hand follows arc, elbow follows smaller arc

**Ball Throw**:
- Arc: parabolic
- Fast at start, slows at apex, accelerates down
- Rotation may be separate from translation

**Walking Foot**:
- Arc: elliptical (up, forward, down, back)
- More vertical during lift, more horizontal during swing

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Straight-line motion for organic objects
- ❌ Wrong pivot point (arc looks off)
- ❌ Linear spacing along arc (should ease)
- ❌ Flat arc (insufficient curvature)

### Conflicts
- **Slow In and Slow Out**: Apply easing along arc path, not just x/y
- **Squash and Stretch**: Orient squash/stretch along arc tangent

### Detection in ANALYZER
```python
# Calculate center of mass trajectory
trajectory_points = [frame1_center, ..., frame2_center]

# Fit arc vs line
arc_fit_error = fit_arc(trajectory_points)
line_fit_error = fit_line(trajectory_points)

if arc_fit_error < line_fit_error * 0.7:
    # Motion is arc-like
    return {"follows_arc": True, "arc_parameters": ...}
```

---

## Principle 8: Secondary Action

### Definition
Additional actions that support and enrich the main action without distracting from it. Examples: facial expression during walk, tail wag during run, breathing during idle.

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Complex character with multiple animatable parts
- Long motion (>12 frames) where secondary adds interest
- User instruction mentions additional details
- Idle or repetitive motion that needs life

**Priority**: 2/5 (Low-Medium - adds polish but not essential)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "main_action": str,            # "walk", "jump", "turn"
    "secondary_actions": [
        {
            "type": str,           # "facial_expression", "breathing", "tail_wag"
            "parts": List[str],    # ["eyes", "mouth"] or ["chest"]
            "sync_with_main": bool, # True=rhythmic sync, False=independent
            "frequency": float,     # If cyclic (Hz or frames per cycle)
            "amplitude": float,     # Subtlety (0.0-1.0)
        }
    ],
    "attention_balance": float     # 0.9 = 90% to main, 10% to secondary
}
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- Secondary must NOT overwhelm primary action
- Keep secondary subtle (10-20% of primary's visual weight)
- Can be rhythmic (synced) or asynchronous
- Adds personality and life

### Examples

**Character Walking**:
- Primary: legs, arms, torso moving
- Secondary: head bobbing slightly, breathing, facial expression

**Dog Running**:
- Primary: legs and body
- Secondary: tail wagging, ears flapping, tongue out

**Character Throwing**:
- Primary: arm motion
- Secondary: facial strain, leg bracing, torso twist

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Secondary too strong (distracts from main)
- ❌ Secondary conflicts with main action
- ❌ Too many secondary actions (chaotic)

### Conflicts
- **Staging**: Secondary must not violate staging clarity
- **Follow Through**: Sometimes secondary IS follow-through

### Note for Telekinesis
Given we're interpolating between 2 keyframes, secondary action is LOW PRIORITY. If both keyframes show secondary action (e.g., different facial expressions), interpolate it. Otherwise, skip.

---

## Principle 9: Timing

### Definition
The number of frames used for an action determines its speed, weight, and personality. Timing conveys mass, mood, and intent.

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- ALWAYS applies (timing is fundamental)
- User specifies frame count or speed
- Object weight/mass affects timing
- Mood affects timing (sad=slow, excited=fast)

**Priority**: 5/5 (Critical - controls entire motion)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "total_frames": int,           # User-requested or calculated
    "speed_category": str,         # "very_slow", "slow", "normal", "fast", "very_fast"
    "frames_per_second": int,      # Target playback (usually 12 or 24)
    "weight_class": str,           # "feather", "light", "medium", "heavy", "massive"
    "timing_beats": List[int],     # Key moments within motion
    "rhythm": str                  # "steady", "syncopated", "accelerating"
}
```

### Timing Guidelines by Weight

| Weight Class | Frames for Jump | Frames for Turn | Feel |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| Feather | 4-6 | 2-3 | Quick, floaty |
| Light | 6-8 | 3-4 | Snappy, energetic |
| Medium | 8-12 | 4-6 | Normal, human |
| Heavy | 12-16 | 6-8 | Powerful, deliberate |
| Massive | 16-24 | 8-12 | Ponderous, inevitable |

### Timing by Mood/Personality

**Excited/Happy**: Fast, snappy timing
**Sad/Tired**: Slow, drawn-out timing
**Angry**: Fast with sudden stops
**Calm/Peaceful**: Slow, smooth timing
**Sneaky**: Very slow with sudden bursts

### Implementation Guidelines
- Heavier = more frames for same action
- More frames ≠ slower playback, it means smoother acceleration
- Use timing to convey emotion and personality
- Coordinate with slow in/out for natural motion

### Examples

**Light Ball Bounce**:
- 6 frames total
- Quick, snappy motion
- Little ease-in/out

**Heavy Ball Bounce**:
- 14 frames total
- Gradual acceleration/deceleration
- Strong ease-in/out

**Character Mood**:
- Happy character: 8 frames to turn head
- Sad character: 14 frames for same turn

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Wrong frame count for object weight
- ❌ Inconsistent timing between similar actions
- ❌ Ignoring user's speed request

### Conflicts
- **Slow In and Slow Out**: Timing (frame count) + Easing (frame spacing) work together

---

## Principle 10: Exaggeration

### Definition
Pushing reality beyond literal truth for dramatic or comedic effect. Pure realism can be boring; exaggeration adds energy and appeal.

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Cartoon or stylized art style
- User instruction mentions: "exaggerated", "bouncy", "cartoony"
- Motion could benefit from more visual interest
- NOT: realistic, subtle, or photo-real styles

**Priority**: 2/5 (Low-Medium - style dependent)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "exaggeration_level": float,   # 0.0=realistic, 1.0=very cartoony
    "exaggerate_what": List[str],  # ["squash_stretch", "arcs", "timing"]
    "style_context": str,          # "cartoon", "anime", "realistic", "stylized"
    "push_factor": float           # Multiplier for detected motion (1.0-2.0)
}
```

### What to Exaggerate

**Squash & Stretch**: 1.5-2x normal deformation
**Arcs**: Make arcs more pronounced
**Timing**: More extreme slow-in/slow-out
**Poses**: Push key poses further (more extreme angles)
**Expressions**: Stronger emotions

### Implementation Guidelines
- Detect art style in ANALYZER (line weights, colors, simplification)
- Cartoonish style → high exaggeration
- Realistic style → low/no exaggeration
- Exaggerate consistently throughout motion

### Examples

**Realistic Style**:
- Ball squash: 0.9 ratio
- Head turn: 30-degree arc
- Subtle easing

**Cartoon Style**:
- Ball squash: 0.6 ratio (much flatter)
- Head turn: 45-degree arc (overshoots)
- Extreme easing (rubber band feel)

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Exaggerating realistic styles (looks wrong)
- ❌ Not exaggerating cartoon styles (looks stiff)
- ❌ Inconsistent exaggeration (some frames cartoony, some not)

### Conflicts
- **Solid Drawing**: Extreme exaggeration can break volume/structure
- **Squash & Stretch**: Exaggeration amplifies squash/stretch

### Note for Telekinesis
Derive exaggeration level from art style analysis. If keyframes are cartoony, PLANNER should amplify motions by 1.2-1.5x.

---

## Principle 11: Solid Drawing

### Definition
Understand forms as three-dimensional objects with volume, weight, and balance. Even in 2D animation, maintain the illusion of 3D space and consistent structure.

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- ALWAYS applies (fundamental to good drawing)
- Objects must maintain volume and proportion
- Forms must feel grounded and balanced

**Priority**: 5/5 (Critical - prevents distortion and morphing)

### Parameters
```python
{
    "volume_consistency": bool,    # Must be True
    "maintain_proportions": bool,  # Must be True
    "anatomy_rules": dict,         # Joint limits, segment lengths
    "3d_thinking": bool,           # Consider rotation in 3D space
    "balance_point": dict,         # Center of gravity
    "symmetry": dict               # What should stay symmetric
}
```

### Key Concepts

**Volume Consistency**:
- Object size should not change arbitrarily
- Squash/stretch must preserve volume
- Camera angle changes may affect apparent size

**Proportions**:
- Head size relative to body
- Limb lengths
- Feature spacing

**Balance**:
- Center of gravity must be supported
- Characters shouldn't look like they're falling
- Weight distribution looks natural

**3D Thinking**:
- Objects rotate in 3D space, not just 2D
- Foreshortening applies
- Occlusion and overlapping correct

### Implementation Guidelines
- Calculate object volumes in both keyframes
- Enforce volume consistency during interpolation
- Check proportions at each frame
- Validate balance (center of gravity over support)
- Maintain structure even during deformation

### Examples

**Character Rotating**:
- ✅ Body parts maintain relative size
- ✅ Foreshortening applied correctly
- ✅ Proportions consistent
- ❌ Head grows larger as it rotates (wrong)

**Ball Bouncing**:
- ✅ Volume preserved during squash/stretch
- ❌ Ball gets smaller in mid-air (wrong)

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Morphing instead of rotating (2D thinking)
- ❌ Volume changes randomly
- ❌ Proportions shift between frames
- ❌ Unbalanced poses (character would fall)

### Conflicts
- **Squash & Stretch**: Must preserve volume during deformation
- **Exaggeration**: Can push proportions, but maintain internal consistency

### Critical for Telekinesis
**This is why naive interpolation fails**. Models like FILM morph pixels without understanding 3D structure. Telekinesis must:
1. Model objects as 3D volumes
2. Enforce volume consistency
3. Use ControlNet (depth, pose) for structural guidance
4. VALIDATOR checks volume per frame

---

## Principle 12: Appeal

### Definition
Create characters and motion that are pleasing to look at. Clear design, readable silhouettes, charisma, and charm. Applies to villains too (interesting to watch, not necessarily likable).

### When to Apply
**Detection Criteria**:
- Always desirable, but subjective
- Focus on: clear silhouettes, clean lines, readable motion
- Avoid: cluttered, ambiguous, or awkward poses

**Priority**: 3/5 (Medium - improves quality but hard to quantify)

### Parameters
```python
{

### Key Concepts

**Clear Silhouette**:
- If you fill shape with black, is it still readable?
- Avoid limbs overlapping in confusing ways
- Keep important features visible

**Clean Lines**:
- Consistent line weights
- No messy, scratchy lines (unless stylistic)
- Smooth curves, clean intersections

**Readable Poses**:
- Action is clear at a glance
- Not ambiguous or confusing
- Body language communicates intent

**Visual Balance**:
- Composition feels stable
- Not too cluttered or too empty
- Pleasing proportions

### Implementation Guidelines
- ANALYZER checks silhouette clarity of keyframes
- VALIDATOR checks generated frames maintain appeal
- Clean up messy lines in REFINER
- Maintain clear silhouettes throughout motion

### Examples

**Good Appeal**:
- Character waving: arm extends outward (clear silhouette)
- Clean, consistent line weights
- Pose is immediately readable

**Poor Appeal**:
- Character waving: arm crosses in front of body (ambiguous)
- Scratchy, uneven lines
- Cluttered pose

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Tangents (lines touching awkwardly)
- ❌ Ambiguous overlaps
- ❌ Messy, inconsistent line work
- ❌ Unbalanced compositions

### Conflicts
- **Staging**: Appeal and staging work together (both about clarity)

### Note for Telekinesis
Mostly relevant for VALIDATOR (quality check) and REFINER (cleanup). Hard to quantify, but important for final quality.

## Principle Interactions Matrix

How principles work together:

| Principle | Complements | Conflicts/Balance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Squash & Stretch | Timing, Exaggeration | Solid Drawing (volume) |
| Anticipation | Timing, Staging | Slow In/Out (pacing) |
| Staging | Appeal, Secondary Action | - |
| Straight/Pose | - | N/A (defines method) |
| Follow Through | Timing, Arc | Solid Drawing (attachment) |
| Slow In/Out | Timing, Arc | - |
| Arc | Slow In/Out, Squash & Stretch | - |
| Secondary Action | Follow Through, Staging | Appeal (clarity) |
| Timing | ALL | - |
| Exaggeration | Squash & Stretch, Arc | Solid Drawing (believability) |
| Solid Drawing | ALL | Squash & Stretch (balance) |
| Appeal | Staging, Solid Drawing | - |

## Decision Trees for Agents

### PRINCIPLES Agent Decision Process

```
1. Analyze motion type:
   - Is there rotation or swinging? → Arc (HIGH priority)
   - Is there acceleration/deceleration? → Slow In/Out (HIGH priority)
   - Is there impact or rapid motion? → Squash & Stretch (if flexible)

2. Check motion magnitude:
   - Large, sudden motion? → Anticipation (MEDIUM priority)
   - Multiple parts with different rigidity? → Follow Through (HIGH priority)

3. Analyze art style:
   - Cartoon/stylized? → Exaggeration (MEDIUM priority)
   - Realistic? → Exaggeration (LOW/NONE)

4. Check complexity:
   - Multi-object scene? → Staging (MEDIUM priority)
   - Long motion? → Secondary Action (LOW priority)

5. Always apply:
   - Timing (HIGH priority)
   - Solid Drawing (HIGH priority)
   - Appeal (MEDIUM priority)

6. Return top 3-5 applicable principles with parameters
```

### VALIDATOR Agent Checklist

```
For each generated frame:
✓ Volume consistency (Solid Drawing)
✓ Motion follows planned arc (Arc)
✓ Frame spacing matches timing curve (Slow In/Out, Timing)
✓ Deformations look natural (Squash & Stretch)
✓ Parts motion is staggered if applicable (Follow Through)
✓ Silhouette is clear (Appeal, Staging)
✓ Lines are clean and consistent (Appeal)
✓ No morphing artifacts (Solid Drawing)

Assign scores per principle, weight by priority
```
