# Claude Context File - Vizier Project
**AI-Assisted 2D Animation Inbetweening Tool**

> This file provides complete context for AI assistants when working on this project. Read this first to understand the project structure, current status, and development guidelines.

---

## Project Overview

**Name**: Vizier
**Purpose**: Help beginner artists create smooth 2D animations by auto-generating intermediate frames between keyframes
**Target User**: Artists using Procreate who struggle with manual inbetweening
**Current Status**: **Multi-Agent System Development** - Phase 0 complete, building intelligent principle-aware animation system

### What It Does
1. User uploads 2 PNG keyframes with transparency (Procreate exports)
2. User describes motion in natural language (e.g., "create 8 bouncy frames")
3. Multi-agent AI system analyzes motion and applies animation principles
4. Specialized agents plan, generate, validate, and refine frames
5. User downloads frames as ZIP → imports back to Procreate

### Animation Philosophy
Vizier supports **classic cel animation techniques** with physics-based interpolation. Objects should **move across the screen**, not fade in/out. See **[docs/ANIMATION_STYLE.md](./ANIMATION_STYLE.md)** for detailed animation principles and testing strategy.

### Current Status: Multi-Agent System Development

**NEW APPROACH**: Principle-Aware Animation System

After discovering limitations with naive frame interpolation, we've pivoted to a **multi-agent architecture** that understands and applies the **12 Principles of Animation**. Instead of treating animation as a pure computer vision problem, we now treat it as an animation problem solved by specialized AI agents.

**Key Innovation**: Rather than simple morphing/interpolation, the system:
- Analyzes what's actually moving between keyframes
- Determines which animation principles apply (arc, squash & stretch, timing, etc.)
- Plans frame-by-frame motion incorporating these principles
- Generates frames with structural guidance (ControlNet, pose estimation)
- Validates quality and adherence to principles
- Iteratively refines until quality threshold is met

**Architecture**: LangGraph-based agent loop with 6 specialized agents
- See [docs/TELEKINESIS_PLAN.md](./TELEKINESIS_PLAN.md) for complete system design
- See [docs/ANIMATION_PRINCIPLES_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](./ANIMATION_PRINCIPLES_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md) for principle reference

**Current Phase**: Phase 0 Complete (Infrastructure) → Moving to Phase 1 (Minimal Viable Pipeline)

**Phase 1 Goals**:
- Implement basic Claude Vision analysis
- Add AnimateDiff frame generation
- End-to-end pipeline execution
- Quality will be rough, but demonstrates agent coordination

## Multi-Agent System Architecture (Telekinesis)

### Overview

The Telekinesis system is a LangGraph-based multi-agent architecture that applies the **12 Principles of Animation** to generate intermediate frames. Rather than naive interpolation, specialized AI agents analyze, plan, generate, validate, and refine frames with deep understanding of animation fundamentals.

**Core Philosophy**: Treat animation as an animation problem, not just a computer vision problem.

### The 6 Agents

#### 1. ANALYZER Agent
**Purpose**: Understand what's changing between keyframes

**Responsibilities**:
- Visual analysis using Claude Vision
- Motion type detection (rotation, translation, deformation)
- Object segmentation and part identification
- Pose detection (MediaPipe for characters)
- Style analysis (line art, cel-shaded, realistic)
- Volume and structure measurement

**Output**: Analysis dictionary with motion characteristics, detected objects, and style information

#### 2. PRINCIPLES Agent
**Purpose**: Determine which of the 12 animation principles apply

**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze motion to identify relevant principles (arc, squash & stretch, timing, etc.)
- Assign confidence scores to each applicable principle
- Extract principle-specific parameters
- Reference Animation Principles Knowledge Base

**Output**: List of applicable principles with confidence scores, parameters, and reasoning

**The 12 Principles**:
1. Squash and Stretch
2. Anticipation
3. Staging
4. Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose
5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action
6. Slow In and Slow Out
7. Arc
8. Secondary Action
9. Timing
10. Exaggeration
11. Solid Drawing
12. Appeal

See [ANIMATION_PRINCIPLES_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](./ANIMATION_PRINCIPLES_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md) for details.

#### 3. PLANNER Agent
**Purpose**: Create detailed frame-by-frame generation plan

**Responsibilities**:
- Generate timing curves based on principles (ease-in, ease-out, custom)
- Calculate arc paths for natural motion
- Plan deformation schedules (squash/stretch per frame)
- Design motion layers for overlapping action
- Determine ControlNet strategy (pose, line art, depth)
- Ensure volume preservation constraints

**Output**: Frame schedule with interpolation parameters, timing curves, and generation strategy

#### 4. GENERATOR Agent
**Purpose**: Create intermediate frames using generative models

**Responsibilities**:
- Execute AnimateDiff with ControlNet guidance
- Apply frame-by-frame deformations
- Generate motion layers separately for overlapping action
- Composite layers with timing offsets
- Preserve transparency from original keyframes

**Output**: List of generated frame image paths

#### 5. VALIDATOR Agent
**Purpose**: Assess quality and principle adherence

**Responsibilities**:
- Quality assessment using Claude Vision
- Volume consistency checking (OpenCV)
- Motion smoothness analysis (optical flow)
- Principle adherence validation (does motion follow planned arc?)
- Style consistency checking (CLIP/DINO features)
- Artifact detection (morphing, ghosting, distortion)

**Output**: Quality score (0-10), principle adherence scores, detected issues, refinement suggestions

**Routing Logic**:
- Quality ≥ 8.0 → END (success)
- Quality < 6.0 and iteration < 2 → REPLAN
- Quality ≥ 6.0 and iteration < 3 → REFINE
- Iteration ≥ 3 → END (accept best effort)

#### 6. REFINER Agent
**Purpose**: Fix specific issues identified by validator

**Responsibilities**:
- Ebsynth style transfer for consistency
- Inpainting for problem regions
- Temporal smoothing to reduce flicker
- Volume normalization
- Line art cleanup and weight adjustment
- Enhance subtle effects (squash/stretch, motion blur)

**Output**: List of refined frame image paths

### Agent Flow Diagram

```

  ↓
[ANALYZER] → analysis
  ↓           (What's moving? How?)
[PRINCIPLES] → animation_principles
  ↓             (Which principles apply?)
[PLANNER] → plan
  ↓          (Frame-by-frame motion plan)
[GENERATOR] → frames

  ├─ quality ≥ 6.0 → [REFINER] → refined_frames → [VALIDATOR]
  └─ quality < 6.0 → [PLANNER] (re-plan)
```

### AnimationState

The state container passed between agents:

```python
class AnimationState(TypedDict):
    # Input
    keyframe1: str
    keyframe2: str
    instruction: str

    # Agent outputs
    analysis: dict
    animation_principles: dict
    plan: dict
    frames: List[str]
    validation: dict
    refined_frames: List[str]

    # Control flow
    iteration_count: int
    messages: List[dict]
```

See `backend/app/telekinesis/state.py` for full definition.

### Integration with Vizier

The Telekinesis system integrates into Vizier's Celery worker:

```python
@celery_app.task(bind=True)
def generate_frames_advanced(self, job_id, kf1, kf2, instruction):
    """Advanced generation using Telekinesis agent loop"""

    graph = build_telekinesis_graph()

    initial_state = {
        "keyframe1": kf1,
        "keyframe2": kf2,
        "instruction": instruction,
        "iteration_count": 0,
        "messages": []
    }

    # Stream execution with progress updates
    for state in graph.stream(initial_state):
        current_agent = list(state.keys())[0]
        self.update_state(
            state='PROGRESS',
            meta={'agent': current_agent, 'progress': calculate_progress(state)}
        )

    return state.get("refined_frames") or state.get("frames")
```

## Key Technical Findings (Phase 0)

### FILM Model Behavior
- **Source**: TensorFlow Hub (`https://tfhub.dev/google/film/1`)
- **Input Format**: Dictionary with keys `{'x0': tensor, 'x1': tensor, 'time': [[t]]}`
- **Output**: `result['image'][0]` - interpolated frame as numpy array
- **Image Format**: RGB only (0.0-1.0 range, sometimes slightly outside)
- **Performance**: ~2-3 seconds per frame on CPU (M-series Mac)
- **Limitations**:
  - Generates 2^n-1 frames recursively (can't request exact count)
  - Requires even dimensions (width/height divisible by 2)
  - No alpha channel support (must handle separately)

### Transparency Handling
**Critical**: FILM only processes RGB channels. Alpha must be separated before processing and interpolated independently.

```python
# Separate alpha before FILM
rgb = np.array(pil_img.convert('RGB')).astype(np.float32) / 255.0
alpha = np.array(pil_img.split()[3]).astype(np.float32) / 255.0

# Interpolate RGB with FILM
result = model({'x0': rgb_batch, 'x1': rgb_batch2, 'time': [[t]]})

# Interpolate alpha linearly
alpha_interpolated = (1 - t) * alpha1 + t * alpha2

# Recombine
rgba = np.dstack([rgb_output * 255, alpha_interpolated * 255])
```

### Claude API
- **Model**: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- **Response Time**: ~1-2 seconds
- **Accuracy**: 100% on test cases
- **Cost**: ~$0.003 per request
- **Output**: Returns valid JSON when prompted correctly

# MVP Plan: AI-Assisted 2D Animation Inbetweening Tool

## Problem Statement

**User Context:**
- Beginner artist using Procreate for 2D animation
- Proficient at drawing individual keyframes
- Struggles with drawing in-between frames (inbetweening/tweening)
- Needs assistance creating smooth transitions between keyframes

**Core Problem:**
Manual frame interpolation is time-consuming and technically challenging for beginners. The tool should accept two keyframes and a natural language description of the desired motion, then automatically generate intermediate frames that bridge the gap.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Accept PNG files with transparency (Procreate export format)
- Parse natural language instructions (e.g., "create 8 bouncy frames") into animation parameters
- Generate intermediate frames that maintain visual consistency
- Preserve transparency in all generated frames
- Provide preview and download capabilities
- Work on local machine without GPU (CPU-only processing acceptable)

**Expected Input:**
- Frame 1: PNG with transparency (start keyframe)
- Frame 2: PNG with transparency (end keyframe)
- Instruction: Natural language text describing desired motion and frame count

**Expected Output:**
- Sequence of PNG frames with transparency preserved
- Downloadable as individual files or ZIP archive
- Importable back into Procreate for further editing

    save_frames(job_id, frames)

    # Stage 5: Complete (100%)
    update_status(job_id, "complete", 100, frames=frame_list)
```

## Docker Services Configuration

### Services
1. **redis**: Redis 7 Alpine (message broker)
2. **backend**: FastAPI server (port 8000)
3. **celery_worker**: Celery worker (concurrency=1)
4. **frontend**: Next.js dev server (port 3000)

### Shared Volumes
- `./uploads:/app/uploads` - Uploaded keyframes
- `./outputs:/app/outputs` - Generated frames
- `./models/film:/models/film:ro` - FILM model (read-only)

### Environment Variables
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...  # Anthropic API key
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0      # Redis connection
API_URL=http://localhost:8000        # Backend URL
```

---

## Key Technical Considerations

### Image Preprocessing Requirements
- FILM requires even dimensions (width and height divisible by 2)
- Optimal resolution: 512-1024px for CPU performance
- Downscale large images (>1024px) to avoid memory issues
- Maintain aspect ratio during resize

### Natural Language Parsing Strategy
- Use Claude with strict JSON output format
- Provide clear examples in system prompt
- Handle cases where Claude returns markdown code blocks
- Validate all required fields present
- Use sensible defaults if parsing fails partially
- Retry once on malformed JSON

### Performance Expectations (CPU-only)
- Claude API call: 1-3 seconds
- Image preprocessing: <1 second per image
- FILM generation: 10-30 seconds per frame pair (depends on resolution)
- Total time for 8 frames: 1-3 minutes
- User should see progress updates every 10-20%

### Error Handling Requirements
- Validate file types (PNG only)
- Check file size limits (max 10MB per frame)
- Handle API failures (Claude, Redis)
- Handle model errors (FILM crashes)
- Clean up temporary files on failure
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### Storage Management
- Each job uses ~100MB (2 keyframes + 8-16 output frames)
- Implement cleanup task for jobs older than 24 hours
- Store job metadata in Redis (expires after 24h)

## MVP Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Successfully upload 2 PNG keyframes with transparency
- Parse natural language instructions with 90%+ accuracy on common phrases
- Generate intermediate frames without crashes
- Preserve transparency in all output frames
- Preview animation with play/pause and scrubbing
- Download frames as properly named ZIP
- Complete processing in under 3 minutes for 8 frames on CPU

### Quality Requirements
- Frames visually interpolate between keyframes (even if not hand-drawn style)
- Transparency edges remain clean (no artifacts)
- Frame numbering is consistent and importable to Procreate
- UI is intuitive for non-technical users
- Error messages are clear and actionable

### Performance Requirements
- Handle images up to 2000x2000px
- Process 4-32 frames per job
- Support concurrent job if needed (single user, unlikely)
- Frontend remains responsive during processing

---

## Known MVP Limitations

1. **No style preservation**: Frames will look interpolated/morphed, not hand-drawn
2. **CPU-only processing**: Slower than GPU (1-3 minutes vs 10-30 seconds)
3. **Single job processing**: Celery configured for one job at a time
4. **No batch mode**: Process one keyframe pair at a time
5. **No manual control**: Cannot adjust timing curves manually
6. **No frame editing**: Cannot modify individual generated frames
7. **No project persistence**: Jobs expire after 24 hours
8. **No Procreate integration**: Manual export/import workflow

## Development Guidelines for AI Assistants

### Code Quality Standards

**Follow Clean Code Principles:**
- **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive variable, function, and class names
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do one thing well
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common logic into reusable functions
- **Small functions**: Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- **Clear comments**: Explain "why" not "what" - code should be self-documenting
- **Type hints**: Use Python type hints and TypeScript types everywhere
- **Error handling**: Use specific exceptions with clear messages
- **No emojis**: NEVER use emojis in code, comments, or documentation - use text markers instead ([COMPLETE], [IN PROGRESS], [WARNING], [FAILED], [X], [DONE])

**Python Style:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries
- Use list comprehensions and generators where appropriate
- Avoid nested conditionals (early returns preferred)
- Use context managers (`with` statements) for file/resource handling

**TypeScript/React Style:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Destructure props and state
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful component names (PascalCase)
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks

### File Organization
- One class/component per file
- Group related functionality in modules
- Keep imports organized (stdlib, third-party, local)
- Use absolute imports where possible

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all services
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names: `test_should_handle_missing_alpha_channel`
- Mock external services (Claude API, Redis)
- Validate test data in `tests/` directory

### Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit changes automatically**

When you make changes:
1. [COMPLETE] Use `git add` to stage files
2. [COMPLETE] Show the user what will be committed with `git status` and `git diff --staged`
3. [FAILED] **NEVER** run `git commit` yourself
4. [FAILED] **NEVER** run `git push` yourself
5. **WAIT** for the user to review and commit manually

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# [COMPLETE] Stage changes
git add backend/app/services/new_service.py
git add backend/app/models/schemas.py

# [COMPLETE] Show what will be committed
git status
git diff --staged

# STOP HERE - tell user:
# "I've staged the changes. Please review with 'git diff --staged'
# and commit when ready."
```

**Commit Message Guidelines (for user reference):**
- Use present tense: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Be concise but descriptive
- Reference issue/phase numbers where applicable
- Format: `<type>: <description>` (e.g., `feat: add celery worker task`)

### Documentation
- Update relevant docs when changing functionality
- Keep this CLAUDE.md file updated with major changes
- Document complex algorithms inline
- Add docstrings to all public functions/classes

### Security Considerations
- Never log API keys or secrets
- Validate all user inputs (file types, sizes, content)
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Never commit `.env` file

## Notes for AI Assistants

1. **Always read this file first** when starting work on this project
2. **IMPORTANT: Only follow top-level docs** - Files in `docs/film/` are archived and NOT current
3. **Current system design**: See [TELEKINESIS_PLAN.md](./TELEKINESIS_PLAN.md) and [PHASE_0_TELEKINESIS_SUMMARY.md](./PHASE_0_TELEKINESIS_SUMMARY.md)
4. **Check [docs/ANIMATION_STYLE.md](./ANIMATION_STYLE.md)** for animation principles
5. **Use test scripts** to validate changes (tests/test_*.py)
6. **Follow the Telekinesis development phases** (Phase 0-6) - don't skip ahead
7. **Stage changes but don't commit** - let the user review and commit
8. **Ask for clarification** if requirements are ambiguous
9. **Update documentation** when making significant changes
10. **NEVER use emojis** - Use text markers: [COMPLETE], [IN PROGRESS], [WARNING], [FAILED], [X], [DONE]
