---

## What Was Built

### 1. Claude Vision Service

Created new service for analyzing keyframe images using Claude's vision capabilities.

**File**: `backend/app/services/claude_vision_service.py`

**Key Features**:
- Base64 image encoding for API transmission
- Structured JSON response with motion analysis
- Support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, WebP, GIF)
- Detailed system prompt for animation-specific analysis
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

**Analysis Output Schema**:
```python
{
    "motion_type": str,  # translation, rotation, deformation, etc.
    "primary_subject": str,  # Description of main moving object
    "motion_magnitude": {
        "distance_percent": float,  # 0-100
        "rotation_degrees": float   # 0-360
    },
    "motion_direction": {
        "description": str,
        "arc_detected": bool
    },
    "motion_energy": str,  # slow, medium, fast, explosive
    "style": str,  # line_art, cel_shaded, painted, realistic, etc.
    "parts_analysis": {
        "moving_parts": List[str],
        "static_parts": List[str]
    },
    "visual_characteristics": {
        "has_deformation": bool,
        "has_motion_blur": bool,
        "has_transparency": bool,
        "num_objects": int,
        "has_background": bool
    },
    "animation_suggestion": str  # Claude's recommendation
}
```

**Methods**:
- `analyze_keyframes(kf1, kf2, instruction)` - Main analysis function
- `quick_describe(image)` - Debug helper for single images
- `_encode_image(path)` - Private helper for base64 encoding

### 2. Frame Generator Service

Created interpolation-based frame generation service as placeholder for AnimateDiff.

**File**: `backend/app/services/frame_generator_service.py`

**Key Features**:
- Linear interpolation (alpha blending) between keyframes
- Easing curve support (linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out)
- RGBA transparency preservation
- Automatic image resizing for dimension mismatches
- Frame-by-frame generation following plan schedule

**Easing Functions**:
- `linear` - Constant speed interpolation
- `ease-in-out` - Cubic smooth start and end
- `ease-in` - Quadratic acceleration
- `ease-out` - Quadratic deceleration

**Methods**:
- `generate_frames(kf1, kf2, plan, job_id)` - Main generation function
- `_interpolate_linear(frame1, frame2, t)` - Alpha blending
- `_apply_easing(t, curve_type)` - Timing curve application
- `_load_image(path)` - Load as RGBA numpy array
- `_save_image(array, path)` - Save as PNG

**Why Not AnimateDiff Yet?**:
AnimateDiff requires:
- Stable Diffusion infrastructure
- GPU acceleration (or very slow CPU)
- ControlNet model weights
- ComfyUI or custom pipeline setup

For Phase 1, simple interpolation proves the pipeline works end-to-end. Phase 3 will integrate AnimateDiff with ControlNet.

### 3. Updated ANALYZER Agent

Modified ANALYZER agent to use Claude Vision service.

**File**: `backend/app/telekinesis/agents.py` (analyzer_agent function)

**Changes**:
- Imports and calls `ClaudeVisionService`
- Passes both keyframes and user instruction to vision analysis
- Logs motion type and style from analysis
- Fallback to placeholder analysis on error
- Marks analysis with `_phase: 1` and `_status: "claude_vision_analyzed"`

**Error Handling**:
If Claude Vision fails (API error, rate limit, etc.), agent falls back to placeholder data and logs error. This ensures pipeline doesn't break during development.

### 4. Updated GENERATOR Agent

Modified GENERATOR agent to use frame generation service.

**File**: `backend/app/telekinesis/agents.py` (generator_agent function)

**Changes**:
- Imports and calls `FrameGeneratorService`
- Generates real PNG files to `outputs/{job_id}/frame_XXX.png`
- Uses plan parameters (num_frames, timing_curve, frame_schedule)
- Logs number of frames generated
- Fallback to placeholder paths on error
- Stores error in state if generation fails

**Output Location**:
Frames are saved to `outputs/{job_id}/` directory with format:
- `frame_000.png` - First keyframe (t=0.0)
- `frame_001.png` - First interpolated frame
- `frame_002.png` - Second interpolated frame
- ...
- `frame_007.png` - Last keyframe (t=1.0)

### 5. Phase 1 Test Script

Created comprehensive test script for end-to-end validation.

**File**: `tests/test_telekinesis_phase1.py`

**Test Flow**:
1. Check for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
2. Verify test images exist (tests/test_images/frame1.png, frame2.png)
3. Build Telekinesis graph
4. Create initial state with test data
5. Execute pipeline (stream agent outputs)
6. Validate all state fields are populated
7. Check that frame files exist on disk
8. Display message log and output summary

**What It Tests**:
- Graph builds without errors
- All agents execute in correct sequence
- ANALYZER produces Claude Vision analysis
- PRINCIPLES returns hardcoded principles
- PLANNER creates frame schedule
- GENERATOR produces actual PNG files
- VALIDATOR returns quality score
- State flows correctly between agents

**Expected Output**:
- Analysis with real motion type and style from Claude
- 8 PNG frames in `outputs/phase1_test/`
- Quality will be blurry/morphed (expected for interpolation)
- Pipeline completes in ~10-30 seconds

### 6. Dependency Updates

Fixed version conflicts in `pyproject.toml`.

**Changed**:
```toml
# Before
"langchain-core==0.3.28"

# After
"langchain-core>=0.3.30"
```

**Reason**: langchain-anthropic 0.3.3 requires langchain-core >=0.3.30, which conflicts with pinned 0.3.28 version.

**Installed Packages** (in .venv):
- langgraph 0.2.60
- langchain 0.3.13
- langchain-anthropic 0.3.3
- langchain-core 0.3.63
- anthropic 0.71.0
- PIL 11.0.0
- opencv-python-headless 4.10.0.84
- numpy 2.2.3
- All other dependencies from pyproject.toml

- Motion will be linear (no arcs or easing yet in image space)
- Transparency should be preserved
- No structural guidance (that's Phase 3 with ControlNet)

This is EXPECTED for Phase 1. The goal is proving the pipeline works.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Interpolation vs AnimateDiff for Phase 1

**Decision**: Use simple linear interpolation instead of AnimateDiff.

**Reasoning**:
- AnimateDiff requires complex Stable Diffusion infrastructure
- Phase 1 goal is proving agent coordination works
- Interpolation generates real files quickly
- Can swap in AnimateDiff later without changing agent interfaces
- Reduces Phase 1 complexity and setup time

**Trade-off**: Lower quality frames, but faster iteration and testing.

### 2. Claude Vision System Prompt Design

**Decision**: Use detailed, animation-specific system prompt.

**Reasoning**:
- Generic image description isn't useful for animation planning
- Need structured output (JSON) for downstream agents
- Animation-specific terms guide Claude to relevant analysis
- Asking for principle suggestions helps with Phase 2 transition

**Prompt Structure**:
1. Define context (inbetweening task)
2. Request specific analysis categories
3. Provide exact JSON schema
4. Include animation terminology

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Graceful fallbacks instead of hard failures.

**Reasoning**:
- API calls can fail (rate limits, network, auth)
- Pipeline should degrade gracefully, not crash
- Fallback data allows testing other agents
- Errors logged for debugging but don't block progress

**Implementation**:
- Try/except blocks around API calls
- Fallback to placeholder data on error
- Mark fallback data with `_status: "fallback"` and `_error` field
- Log errors for visibility

### 4. Frame Output Organization

**Decision**: Save frames to `outputs/{job_id}/frame_XXX.png`.

**Reasoning**:
- Separate directory per job prevents conflicts
- Sequential numbering matches animation frame conventions
- Easy to import into animation software (Procreate, etc.)
- Matches existing Vizier project structure

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

### Quality

1. **Blurry morphing**: Linear interpolation creates ghosting/morphing artifacts
2. **No structural preservation**: Objects lose shape during motion
3. **No arc following**: Motion is linear in pixel space, not natural arcs
4. **No squash/stretch**: No deformation applied
5. **No style matching**: Generated frames don't match keyframe art style

**All addressed in later phases** (Phase 3: ControlNet, Phase 5: Deformation)

### Functionality

1. **Hardcoded principles**: PRINCIPLES agent doesn't analyze, just returns defaults
2. **No quality validation**: VALIDATOR always passes (score 8.0)
3. **No refinement loop**: REFINER not called, no iteration
4. **No pose guidance**: No skeletal structure preservation
5. **Simple timing**: Linear interpolation only (easing in time, not space)

**All planned for later phases**

### Performance

1. **Claude API latency**: ~2-5 seconds for vision analysis
2. **Sequential execution**: Agents run one at a time
3. **No caching**: Every run calls Claude API fresh
4. **Unoptimized interpolation**: Processes full resolution images

**Optimization in Phase 6**

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Once Phase 1 testing is complete, Phase 2 will focus on enhancing analysis and principle detection:

### Phase 2 Goals

1. **Real Principle Detection**:
   - Use Claude to analyze which of the 12 principles apply
   - Confidence scoring for each principle
   - Parameter extraction (arc curves, timing needs, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Motion Analysis**:
   - MediaPipe pose detection for character motion
   - OpenCV optical flow for motion magnitude
   - Object segmentation for multi-part analysis

3. **Principle Integration**:
   - PLANNER incorporates detected principles
   - Different plans for different motion types
   - Principle-aware parameter tuning

### Expected Outcomes

- Intelligent principle identification (not hardcoded)
- Better planning based on actual motion characteristics
- Still using interpolation (ControlNet in Phase 3)
- Foundation for quality improvement loop
