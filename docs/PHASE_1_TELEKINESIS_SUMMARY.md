## What Was Built

### 1. Claude Vision Service

Created new service for analyzing keyframe images using Claude's vision capabilities.

**File**: `backend/app/services/claude_vision_service.py`

**Key Features**:
- Base64 image encoding for API transmission
- Structured JSON response with motion analysis
- Support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, WebP, GIF)
- Detailed system prompt for animation-specific analysis
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- **Prompt caching** for system prompts to reduce latency and costs

**Analysis Output Schema**:
```python
{
    "motion_type": str,  # translation, rotation, deformation, etc.
    "primary_subject": str,  # Description of main moving object
    "motion_magnitude": {
        "distance_percent": float,  # 0-100
        "rotation_degrees": float   # 0-360
    },
    "motion_direction": {
        "description": str,
        "arc_detected": bool
    },
    "motion_energy": str,  # slow, medium, fast, explosive
    "style": str,  # line_art, cel_shaded, painted, realistic, etc.
    "parts_analysis": {
        "moving_parts": List[str],
        "static_parts": List[str]
    },
    "visual_characteristics": {
        "has_deformation": bool,
        "has_motion_blur": bool,
        "has_transparency": bool,
        "num_objects": int,
        "has_background": bool
    },
    "animation_suggestion": str  # Claude's recommendation
}
```

**Methods**:
- `analyze_keyframes(kf1, kf2, instruction)` - Main analysis function
- `quick_describe(image)` - Debug helper for single images
- `_encode_image(path)` - Private helper for base64 encoding

### 2. Frame Generator Service

Created object-based motion interpolation service that respects animation principles.

**File**: `backend/app/services/frame_generator_service.py`

**CRITICAL DESIGN DECISION**: Object-Based Motion, Not Pixel Blending

Initial implementation used pixel-level alpha blending, which caused objects to fade in/out instead of moving. This violated the core animation principle: **"Objects should move across the screen, not fade in/out."**

**New Approach**:
1. **Detect objects** using color-based segmentation (OpenCV)
2. **Extract properties**: position (centroid), color (average RGB), shape (contour)
3. **Interpolate properties**: position and color linearly
4. **Render cleanly**: Draw object at intermediate position with intermediate color

**Key Features**:
- Object detection using alpha channel and color thresholding
- Morphological operations for clean masks
- Contour-based shape extraction
- Position interpolation (centroids)
- Color interpolation (RGB values)
- Clean rendering with PIL ImageDraw
- Easing curve support for timing (linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out)
- RGBA transparency preservation

**Methods**:
- `generate_frames(kf1, kf2, plan, job_id)` - Main generation function
- `_detect_object(image)` - Find and extract object properties
- `_render_object_frame(canvas_shape, obj1, obj2, t)` - Render at interpolated state
- `_apply_easing(t, curve_type)` - Timing curve application
- `_load_image(path)` - Load as RGBA numpy array
- `_save_image(array, path)` - Save as PNG

**Why Not AnimateDiff Yet?**:
AnimateDiff requires:
- Stable Diffusion infrastructure
- GPU acceleration (or very slow CPU)
- ControlNet model weights
- ComfyUI or custom pipeline setup

For Phase 1, object-based interpolation:
- ✅ Proves pipeline works end-to-end
- ✅ Respects animation principle (motion not fading)
- ✅ Simple, fast, no ML models needed
- ✅ Clean frames with single solid object

Phase 3 will integrate AnimateDiff with ControlNet for more complex motions and better quality.

### 3. Updated ANALYZER Agent

Modified ANALYZER agent to use Claude Vision service.

**File**: `backend/app/telekinesis/agents.py` (analyzer_agent function)

**Changes**:
- Imports and calls `ClaudeVisionService`
- Passes both keyframes and user instruction to vision analysis
- Logs motion type and style from analysis
- Fallback to placeholder analysis on error
- Marks analysis with `_phase: 1` and `_status: "claude_vision_analyzed"`

**Error Handling**:
If Claude Vision fails (API error, rate limit, etc.), agent falls back to placeholder data and logs error. This ensures pipeline doesn't break during development.

### 4. Updated GENERATOR Agent

Modified GENERATOR agent to use frame generation service.

**File**: `backend/app/telekinesis/agents.py` (generator_agent function)

**Changes**:
- Imports and calls `FrameGeneratorService`
- Generates real PNG files to `outputs/{job_id}/frame_XXX.png`
- Uses plan parameters (num_frames, timing_curve, frame_schedule)
- Logs number of frames generated
- Fallback to placeholder paths on error
- Stores error in state if generation fails

**Output Location**:
Frames are saved to `outputs/{job_id}/` directory with format:
- `frame_000.png` - First keyframe (t=0.0)
- `frame_001.png` - First interpolated frame
- `frame_002.png` - Second interpolated frame
- ...
- `frame_007.png` - Last keyframe (t=1.0)

### 5. Test Scripts

Created two test scripts to validate the Phase 1 implementation.

#### Test 1: Object Motion Test (API-Free)

**File**: `tests/test_object_motion.py`

**Purpose**: Verify object detection and motion interpolation without needing Claude API.

**Test Flow**:
1. Load keyframe images (red ball left, blue ball right)
2. Detect objects in both keyframes
3. Extract position (centroid) and color (average RGB)
4. Verify objects are in different positions and colors
5. Generate 5 interpolated frames (t=0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)
6. Verify middle frame has object at center position (not ghosting)
7. Verify corners are clean (no fading artifacts)

**What It Tests**:
- Object detection works correctly
- Position and color extraction
- Interpolation creates actual motion
- No fading/ghosting artifacts
- Clean rendering

**Results**:
✅ **PASSED** - Objects detected correctly, frames show clean motion from left to right with color transition from red→purple→blue.

**Output**: `outputs/object_motion_test/`

#### Test 2: Full Pipeline Test (Requires API)

**File**: `tests/test_telekinesis_phase1.py`

**Purpose**: End-to-end validation of complete agent pipeline with Claude Vision.

**Test Flow**:
1. Check for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
2. Verify test images exist (tests/test_images/frame1.png, frame2.png)
3. Build Telekinesis graph
4. Create initial state with test data
5. Execute pipeline (stream agent outputs)
6. Validate all state fields are populated
7. Check that frame files exist on disk
8. Display message log and output summary

**What It Tests**:
- Graph builds without errors
- All agents execute in correct sequence
- ANALYZER produces Claude Vision analysis
- PRINCIPLES returns hardcoded principles
- PLANNER creates frame schedule
- GENERATOR produces actual PNG files with object-based motion
- VALIDATOR returns quality score
- State flows correctly between agents

**Expected Output**:
- Analysis with real motion type and style from Claude
- 8 PNG frames in `outputs/phase1_test/`
- Frames show clean object motion (not blurry morphing)
- Pipeline completes in ~10-30 seconds

### 6. Dependency Updates

Fixed version conflicts in `pyproject.toml` and confirmed OpenCV is available.

**Changed**:
```toml
# Before
"langchain-core==0.3.28"

# After
"langchain-core>=0.3.30"
```

**Reason**: langchain-anthropic 0.3.3 requires langchain-core >=0.3.30, which conflicts with pinned 0.3.28 version.

**Key Dependencies** (in .venv):
- opencv-python-headless 4.10.0.84 - Required for object detection
- langgraph 0.2.60 - Agent orchestration
- langchain 0.3.13 - LLM framework
- langchain-anthropic 0.3.3 - Claude integration
- langchain-core 0.3.63 - Core abstractions
- anthropic 0.71.0 - Claude API client
- Pillow 11.0.0 - Image processing
- numpy 2.2.3 - Array operations
- All other dependencies from pyproject.toml

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Object-Based Motion vs AnimateDiff for Phase 1

**Decision**: Use object-based motion interpolation instead of AnimateDiff.

**Reasoning**:
- AnimateDiff requires complex Stable Diffusion infrastructure
- Phase 1 goal is proving agent coordination works
- **Object-based approach respects animation principles** (motion, not fading)
- Simple computer vision (OpenCV) - no ML models needed
- Generates real files quickly with clean motion
- Can swap in AnimateDiff later without changing agent interfaces
- Reduces Phase 1 complexity and setup time

**Why Not Pixel Blending**:
Initial approach used alpha blending (morphing), which created fading/ghosting artifacts. This violated the fundamental animation principle that objects should **move**, not **fade**. Object-based approach solves this by:
1. Detecting objects separately
2. Interpolating their properties (position, color)
3. Rendering clean frames

**Trade-off**: Limited to single simple objects, but demonstrates correct animation fundamentals.

### 2. Claude Vision System Prompt Design

**Decision**: Use detailed, animation-specific system prompt.

**Reasoning**:
- Generic image description isn't useful for animation planning
- Need structured output (JSON) for downstream agents
- Animation-specific terms guide Claude to relevant analysis
- Asking for principle suggestions helps with Phase 2 transition

**Prompt Structure**:
1. Define context (inbetweening task)
2. Request specific analysis categories
3. Provide exact JSON schema
4. Include animation terminology

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Graceful fallbacks instead of hard failures.

**Reasoning**:
- API calls can fail (rate limits, network, auth)
- Pipeline should degrade gracefully, not crash
- Fallback data allows testing other agents
- Errors logged for debugging but don't block progress

**Implementation**:
- Try/except blocks around API calls
- Fallback to placeholder data on error
- Mark fallback data with `_status: "fallback"` and `_error` field
- Log errors for visibility

### 4. Frame Output Organization

**Decision**: Save frames to `outputs/{job_id}/frame_XXX.png`.

**Reasoning**:
- Separate directory per job prevents conflicts
- Sequential numbering matches animation frame conventions
- Easy to import into animation software (Procreate, etc.)
- Matches existing Vizier project structure

### 5. Prompt Caching Implementation

**Decision**: Require Anthropic's prompt caching on all system prompts in Claude API calls.

**Reasoning**:
- System prompts are static and identical across requests
- Caching reduces latency by ~50% on cache hits
- Cached tokens cost 90% less than regular input tokens
- Especially valuable during validator→refiner refinement loops
- No reason to allow operation without caching - enforce optimal performance

**Implementation**:
Both Claude services now use the cache control format and validate caching is working:
```python
system=[
    {
        "type": "text",
        "text": SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}
    }
]

# Validate that prompt caching is working
usage = response.usage
if not hasattr(usage, 'cache_creation_input_tokens') and not hasattr(usage, 'cache_read_input_tokens'):
    raise Exception("Prompt caching is not enabled or not working.")
```

**Expected Benefits**:
- **Instruction parser**: Saves ~22 lines of system prompt per request
- **Keyframe analyzer**: Saves ~63 lines of system prompt per request
- **Refinement loops**: Cached prompts speed up each iteration
- **Cost savings**: Approximately 50-70% reduction in prompt token costs for repeated requests
- **Latency improvement**: Faster response times on subsequent API calls

**Cache Behavior**:
- Cache TTL: 5 minutes of inactivity
- Cache key: Based on exact prompt text
- First request: Creates cache (normal latency)
- Subsequent requests (within 5 min): Use cache (reduced latency)
- **Enforcement**: Services will fail if caching is unavailable, ensuring optimal performance

---

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

### Scope

1. **Single simple objects only**: Can only handle one primary object per scene
2. **No complex shapes**: Works best with simple geometric shapes
3. **No deformation**: Shape doesn't change, only position and color
4. **Linear motion only**: No arc following (straight line motion)
5. **No squash/stretch**: No deformation applied
6. **No style matching**: Renders with solid colors, not original art style
7. **No backgrounds**: Only handles foreground objects

**All addressed in later phases** (Phase 3: ControlNet, Phase 5: Deformation)

### Functionality

1. **Hardcoded principles**: PRINCIPLES agent doesn't analyze, just returns defaults
2. **No quality validation**: VALIDATOR always passes (score 8.0)
3. **No refinement loop**: REFINER not called, no iteration
4. **No pose guidance**: No skeletal structure preservation
5. **Simple timing**: Linear interpolation only (easing in time, not space)

**All planned for later phases**

### Performance

1. **Claude API latency**: ~2-5 seconds for vision analysis (first call), ~1-3 seconds with prompt caching
2. **Sequential execution**: Agents run one at a time
3. **Prompt caching enabled**: System prompts cached for 5 minutes, reducing costs and latency
4. **Unoptimized interpolation**: Processes full resolution images

**Further optimization in Phase 6**

   - Object segmentation for multi-part analysis

3. **Principle Integration**:
   - PLANNER incorporates detected principles
   - Different plans for different motion types
   - Principle-aware parameter tuning

### Expected Outcomes

- Intelligent principle identification (not hardcoded)
- Better planning based on actual motion characteristics
