# Vizier - AI-Assisted 2D Animation Inbetweening Tool

## Overview
Vizier helps artists create smooth 2D animations by auto-generating intermediate frames between keyframes. Designed for artists working with tools like Procreate who want to achieve old-school cel animation quality with modern AI assistance.

## Animation Style Philosophy

Vizier is built to support **classic cel animation techniques** with a focus on eccentric, boundary-pushing animation exemplified by films like:

- **The Thief and the Cobbler** (Richard Williams)
- Dynamic tracking shots and camera movements
- Complex perspective systems with moving vanishing points
- True parallax depth (not simple multiplane)

### Key Principle: Physics-Based Interpolation

Unlike simple crossfading or morphing, Vizier uses **motion-aware interpolation** to ensure:

- **Objects move, not fade**: A red ball on the left becomes a blue ball on the right by actually moving across the screen while changing color (purple in the middle), not by fading out and fading in
- **Spatial continuity**: Objects maintain identity and follow natural motion paths
- **Proper property interpolation**: Color, position, scale, and rotation all transition smoothly

**Example:**
```
Frame 1: Red ball at left (x=10)
Frame 2: Purple ball at center (x=50)  ‚Üê Generated by Vizier
Frame 3: Blue ball at right (x=90)
```

## Features

- Upload 2 PNG keyframes with transparency
- Describe motion in natural language (e.g., "create 8 bouncy frames")
- AI-powered frame interpolation using Google's FILM model
- Download frames as ZIP for import into Procreate or other animation tools

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Celery, Redis, TensorFlow (FILM model)
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **AI**: Google FILM (Frame Interpolation for Large Motion), Claude API
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose

## Current Status

Phase 0 Complete - Environment validated, ready for Phase 1 development.

See [PHASE_0_SUMMARY.md](docs/PHASE_0_SUMMARY.md) for detailed validation results.

## Quick Start (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Access application
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Development
